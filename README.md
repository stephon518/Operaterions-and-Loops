**Functions, Methods & Objects**



Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. They also allow you to take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value. In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.



JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).



Evaluating Conditions & Conditional Statements



There are  two components to a decision. The first one is an expression evaluated, which returns a value. The second is a condition statement says what to do in given situation.
